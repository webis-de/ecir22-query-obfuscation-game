</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="will the body"></a><strong>I signed a body donation consent form 10 years ago and recently heard that a new law, affecting body donation, came into force in 2006. Will the consent form I originally signed be accepted when I die or must I complete a new form?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Although the new law affecting body donation (the Human Tissue Act 2004) came into force on 1 September 2006, it allows documented and valid consent for body donation made under the old law to be honoured. To avoid any unnecessary confusion or delays after you die, it is recommended that you include an updated intention to donate your body in your Will. More details can be obtained directly from the anatomy establishment to which you wish to donate your body.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contact details for medical schools are available to download from the left side of this page.</p>
<p><strong><a name="i have recently"></a>I have recently moved to a different part of the country. Will I need to fill in a new body donation consent form?<br/><br/></strong>Not necessarily. A form completed for one anatomy establishment might also be acceptable to another. More details can be obtained directly from the anatomy establishment to which you wish to donate your body.</p>
<p>If you have moved to a new area of the country, but still want to donate your body to the anatomy establishment linked to your old post code, please contact the establishment for more details. Some medical schools may request that your estate contributes to the cost of transporting your body if the donation falls outside of the medical school’s local area.</p>
<p>Contact details for medical schools are available to download from the left side of this page.</p>
<p><strong><a name="can i donate"></a>Can I donate my body if I am also on the Organ Donor Register?</strong><br/> <br/>People who choose to donate their body or organs do so in the hope that they will be useful to others after their death. Despite being separate donation systems, it is possible for a person to be registered as an organ donor and to have registered their wish to donate their body, after death, to a medical school.</p>
<p>Medical schools will usually decline a body donation if the person has undergone surgery to remove organs for transplantation. However, if after their death, the person is found unsuitable to be an organ donor, then body donation to a medical school can be taken forward by the relatives, solicitor or executor of the Will; assuming valid consent is in place - please see <a>How to donate your body</a></p>
<p>If a person wishes to register for both organ donation and body donation, the HTA suggests that the person includes this in their Will and ensures that those closest to them are aware of their wishes.</p>
<p>For more information on organ donation please visit the <a target="_blank">NHS Blood and Transplant</a> website.</p>
<p><strong><a name="are there any"></a>Are there any limitations or conditions to body donation?</strong><br/> <br/>All medical schools welcome the offer of a donation. However, certain medical conditions may lead to the offer being declined. These conditions and any other reasons for a body donation being declined can be obtained from each medical school.</p>
<p>Contact details for medical schools are available to download from the left side of this page.</p>
<p><strong><a name="what happens if"></a>What happens if my body is not accepted?</strong><br/> <br/>If a medical school is unable to accept your donation, they may be able to help you find another school which can accept your body.</p>
<p>However, if no medical school is able to accept your offer, your estate will need to make suitable funeral arrangements.</p>
<p><strong><a name="if i donate"></a>If I donate my body, will there be a funeral or memorial service?</strong><br/> <br/>Medical schools will usually arrange for donated bodies to be cremated, unless the family requests the return of the body for a private burial or cremation.</p>
<p>Medical schools may hold a memorial service. Further information can be obtained directly from the medical school.</p>
<p>Contact details for medical schools are available to download from the right-hand side of this page.</p>
<p><strong><a name="are there any"></a>Are there any costs or payments involved?</strong><br/> <br/>You will not receive any payment for donating your body.</p>
<p>Some medical schools may request that the donor’s estate contribute to the cost of transporting the body, particularly if the donation falls outside of the medical school’s local area. Full details can be obtained directly from the medical school.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Isle of Mann"></a>Can I donate my body if I live in the Isle of Man or Channel Islands?</strong> <br/><br/>The Human Tissue Act 2004 (HT Act) does not apply to the Isle of Man or Channel Islands and they have no body donation process of their own. It might be possible for a medical school on the UK mainland to accept a body donation from an Isle of Man or Channel Islands resident, as long as the requirements of the HT Act are met.</p>
<p>You may need to make financial arrangements with a local funeral director, in relation to the transportation of your body to the medical school of your choice. To enquire about whether this might be possible, please contact your nearest medical school.</p>
<p>Contact details for medical schools are available to download from the left side of this page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="Scotland"></a><strong>What is the process for body donation in Scotland?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The HTA has no role in regulating anatomy teaching in Scotland. If you live in Scotland and wish to donate your body, you will find contact details on the left side of this page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="exist"></a><strong>What options exist if a witness did not sign the consent form?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>If somone wants to donate their body for medical research but at the time of death it is discovered that a witness has not signed their consent form, the only option is donating their brain to a bank, however the brain bank would probably have to receive it within 48 hours. Brain banks usually accept consent from a next of kin but they have the right to decline.</p>
