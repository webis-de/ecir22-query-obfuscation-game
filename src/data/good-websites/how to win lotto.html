<h1>German National Lotto Tips</h1>
<img alt="" class="left3" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20111208100343im_/http://www.smartluck.com/free-lottery-tips/balloons/lotto.jpg"/>
<p>The German National Lotto 6/49 number field has not been changed since the game began October 9, 1955. Even the Long Term Trend Charts have well-defined patterns. With all this historical data available, it makes sense to study the patterns in Gail Howard's <a>Advantage Plus</a> software and choose numbers that have the greatest probability of winning. The player chooses six numbers from 1 to 49. Drawings are held twice a week on Saturdays and Wednesdays. The odds of winning the first prize jackpot are one in 13,983,816. </p>
<p>Below are a few tips to help you play the game smarter, but Gail Howard's lotto book, <a><em>Lottery Master Guide</em></a>, explains all of Gail Howard's successful methods of <a>number selection</a> in great detail with examples of patterns shown throughout. <a>Advantage Plus</a> software makes all the charts for this game; and the wheeling software to use is <a>Wheel Six Gold</a>. If you use the Advantage Plus software, when pressing 'Alt.+ B' you can see all the charts both with the bonus number and all charts without the bonus number and press it again and you will see all the charts made with the bonus number alone. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h2>Gail Howard's Lottery Strategies to Help You Win the Germany National Lotto Game</h2>
<p>Here are a few lottery tips on number selection from Gail Howard's lotto strategy book, <a><em>Lottery Master Guide</em></a>, which have been customized for this specific game: German National Lotto 6aus49. </p>
<p>Lottery numbers are randomly drawn. But randomly drawn numbers form patterns that can be tracked and used to our advantage. Having carefully analyzed all the drawings in past <a>lotto results</a> of more than 190 different lotto games worldwide, with histories going back as far as 1955, Gail Howard has verified the following incredibly simple rule: </p>
<div class="center">
<strong>That which is MOST POSSIBLE happens MOST OFTEN.<br/> That which is LEAST POSSIBLE happens LEAST OFTEN.</strong>
</div>
<p>The key to Gail Howard's successful lotto number selection methods is playing the probabilities. If you play a pattern that occurs only five percent of the time, you can expect that pattern to lose 95 percent of the time, giving you no chance to win 95 percent of the time. So, don't buck the probabilities. </p>
<h2>How to WIN Germany National Lotto</h2>
<h3 class="tipsh3">ODD-EVEN LOTTO NUMBER TIPS</h3>
<p class="tips">When you select your lotto numbers, try to have a relatively even mix of odd and even numbers. All <a>odd numbers</a> or all <a>even numbers</a> are rarely drawn, occurring less than 3 percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two odd and four even, or four odd and two even, or three odd and three even. One of these three patterns will occur in 81 percent of the drawings. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">HIGH-LOW LOTTO NUMBER TIPS</h3>
<p class="tips">Winning numbers are usually spread across the entire <a>number field</a>. If we take a number field and cut it in half, we have the low half and the high half. In a 49-number game, numbers 1 to 25 would be in the low half, and numbers 26 to 49 would be in the high half. All <a>high numbers</a> or all <a>low numbers</a> are rarely drawn, occurring only 3 percent of the time. The best mix is to have 2/4, 4/2 or 3/3, which means two high and four low, or four high and two low, or three high and three low. Winning number groups with these three patterns occur in 81 percent of all drawings. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">LOTTERY NUMBER GROUP STRATEGIES</h3>
<p class="tips">Look at a list of past winning numbers for Germany Lotto, and you'll see, more often than not, that one or more of the <a>number groups</a> is not represented. For example, in the combination 5-14-17-32-38-49, there are no 20's. Tracking and studying Number Groups can help you decide which group to omit and which group to give extra heavy play. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">LOTTERY GAMES SKIPPED STRATEGIES</h3>
<p class="tips">List the number of <a>games skipped (games out)</a> since the last hit (win) for each of the <a>winning numbers</a> during the last five games. Then mark the number of times each skip occurred. If any skip from 0 to 5 did not occur, play the Lotto numbers that are out that many games. (<a>Help working with lotto games skipped</a>.) </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">LOTTO NUMBER SUM ADVICE - PLAY A BALANCED GAME<sup class="font8">®</sup></h3>
<p class="tips">Add together the six numbers you want to play and make sure that the <a>sum</a> of the six numbers adds up to somewhere between 115 and 185. Sums that fall within that range will account for over 70 percent of all <a>lottery jackpots</a> won. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">REPEAT HITS LOTTERY TIPS</h3>
<p class="tips">In German National Lotto, on average, one lottery number will be a <a>repeat hit</a> from the last drawing 56 percent of the time. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">HOT NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS</h3>
<p class="tips">Numbers that have been out (losers) for four games or less account for about half of the <a>winning numbers</a> drawn. <a>Losing numbers</a> that have been out for six games or less account for about two-thirds of all the <a>winning numbers</a>. Numbers out ten games or less account for about 81 percent of the six winning numbers. This tells us that hot numbers are more likely to hit, but don't forget to include at least one long shot in your group of 6. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">COLD NUMBER LOTTERY SECRETS</h3>
<p class="tips">It is difficult to know when a <a>cold number</a> will end a long losing streak. If you play a number every drawing because you think it is <strong>due</strong>, you could be chasing it for many months. (Number 45 in New York Lotto sat out 100 drawings before it finally hit.) Although, when a number has been out for 70 games or so, it might be worth chasing. </p>
<h2>Lottery Pools and Lottery Syndicates</h2>
<h3 class="tipsh3">POOL YOUR WAY TO LOTTO RICHES</h3>
<p class="tips">Several of the <a>106
      <!-- wincnt --> Lotto jackpots won with Gail Howard's lottery systems</a> were won by groups of people who pooled their money. Sharing the ticket cost with others stretches your Lotto budget. By playing with a group, you can afford to buy more lottery tickets—and play larger wheeling systems—than you could (or should) by yourself. Draw up an agreement and have the members of your pool sign it. </p>
<h2>How to Get Lucky in Lotto</h2>
<h3 class="tipsh3">CASH IN ON THE LUCK OF OTHERS</h3>
<p class="tips">When you form a Lotto pool, your group is also pooling its aggregate luck. A jackpot could happen because of the luck just one member brings to your pool. Select your partners carefully. Share your luck with winners, not losers. Avoid negative people. Not only are they unlucky, but they dampen enthusiasm and drain energy from others. You want to enhance your own luck, not dilute its strength. One quick way to tell winners from losers is simply to ask them: "Do you think you are a lucky person?" Many people quickly admit, "I'm unlucky. I never win anything." They won't bring good luck to your group either. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">CASH IN ON A POSITIVE ATTITUDE</h3>
<p class="tips">No one should play games of chance out of desperation because they need the winnings. The needy have a greater fear of losing the hard-earned money they gamble with. It is just one of life's dirty tricks that the very fear of losing blocks the winning forces. Thoughts are charged with energy, especially when triggered by emotion. Fear attracts exactly that which one fears. A strong desire for a goal that is charged with positive energy, attracts a positive response, especially when every effort is made to attain that goal. </p>
<h2>Lottery Wheels</h2>
<h3 class="tipsh3">USE BALANCED WHEEL<sup class="sup9">®</sup> SYSTEMS</h3>
<p class="tips"><a>Balanced Wheeling<sup class="sup9">®</sup> Systems</a> allow you to bet a large group of numbers (more than 5), play scientific combinations of that group of numbers, and get a specific <a>minimum win guarantee</a>. Balanced Wheels<sup class="font8">®</sup> force all the winning numbers that are in your group to come together to give you at least one prize if some or all of the <a>winning numbers</a> are in your chosen group. </p>
<p class="tips">It's true that the more numbers you wheel, the easier it is to trap the winning numbers in your chosen group. But to get the most leverage for your money, the optimum number of numbers to wheel is not more than four or five numbers over HALF the numbers in your game. Otherwise, you'll be spending MORE money chasing a SMALLER guaranteed prize. You benefit more by wheeling a carefully selected group of lotto numbers. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">THE BEST WAY TO WHEEL ALL THE LOTTO NUMBERS IN YOUR GAME</h3>
<p class="tips">Any one wheeling system that covers ALL the numbers in the game is too spread out, making the win guarantee not worth the wager. There are smart ways to wheel all the numbers in the game by using Trap-by-Overlap and other wheeling strategies covered on pages 137 to 142 in the <em>Lottery Master Guide.</em> </p>
<p class="tips">Most of Gail Howard's lottery winners used a Balanced Wheel<sup class="font8">®</sup> in addition to her Smart Luck<sup class="sup9">®</sup> number selection methods. You can use a <a>FREE interactive Balanced Wheel<sup class="font8">®</sup> System</a> that won multiple jackpots. Read about Gail Howard's <a>lottery winners</a>, too. And when you win a jackpot with Gail Howard's lotto systems, tell us about it so you can be added to Gail Howard's growing list of winners. If you don't want your name publicized, Gail Howard will honor that. </p>
<h2>Save Money by Knowing Lotto Numbers to Avoid</h2>
<p>Lotto players who select their lottery numbers thoughtlessly or foolishly are destined to lose even before the drawing takes place. By knowing which <a>number combinations</a> and patterns to avoid, you'll have an advantage over such players—and save money, too. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BEFORE</h3>
<p class="tips">Many players like to bet the numbers that have won someone else a big jackpot, and by doing so, they are almost guaranteed NOT to win one themselves. In German Lotto, with two drawings a week, a set of six numbers has a chance of being drawn once every 134,459 years. This should also answer the question Gail Howard is so often asked, "Shouldn't I keep playing the same set of numbers every week because they are due to hit sometime?" </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID BETTING SIX CONSECUTIVE LOTTO NUMBERS</h3>
<p class="tips">Six consecutive numbers have never been drawn in any state or international lotto game. Gail Howard has all the drawing results for more than 180 state and international lottery games, going back more than fifty years! Even five <a>consecutive numbers</a> is a very rare occurrence that, in most Lotto games, has never happened once. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID BETTING ONE LOTTO NUMBER GROUP</h3>
<p class="tips">Never choose all six numbers from one number group, such as all single digits, or all teens, or all 20's, etc. All six winning numbers drawn from one group is highly unlikely. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID THE LOTTO COMBINATION 1-2-3-4-5-6</h3>
<p class="tips">The most popular set of numbers most often played is: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Thousands of tickets are bought with this combination every drawing. The selection is too far out of balance to come up in a random drawing. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID PATTERN BETTING</h3>
<p class="tips"><a>Pattern betting</a> is an even more popular method of marking bet slips. Patterns of numbers marked in a row to make a straight line, either across the bet slip vertically or diagonally get heavy play—which means sharing the prize with others if the numbers are drawn as winners. Other designs such as patterns of initials or numbers or crosses also get heavy play. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID NUMBER MULTIPLES</h3>
<p class="tips">Other popular combinations that get heavy play are the number multiples, especially 5-10-15-20-25-30 and 7-14-21-28-35-42. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID ALL SAME LAST DIGITS</h3>
<p class="tips">Many people like to play same last digits, such as 3-13-23-33-43, or all digits that end in seven, or some other favorite lucky lottery number. Even four same last digits occur in less than two-tenths of one percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with three last digits the same occur in less than 3 percent of all drawings. Winning sets of numbers with no more than one repeated last digit represent nearly 90 percent of all drawings. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">AVOID LOW NUMBER COMBINATIONS</h3>
<p class="tips">The majority of Lotto players like to play the calendar numbers, such as birth dates and anniversaries—and their children's ages. This means that the most heavily played numbers are 1 through 31. German Lotto has 49 numbers. If you play only the calendar numbers, you might be sharing your jackpot with dozens of other winners. It's not to say that you shouldn't play your personal numbers if you feel these lucky numbers are good to play. But Gail Howard recommends that you include a couple of high numbers so that just in case your numbers do hit, you win a prize that's worth something. </p>
<h3 class="tipsh3">NIX LOTTO QUICK PICKS</h3>
<p class="tips"><a>Quick Picks</a> are used by lazy people who want to be in the action without putting any effort into winning. When you read articles about jackpot winners, it appears as though they all used either Quick Picks, birth dates, or their children's ages. The vast majority of people do play that way. If the majority of tickets sold are Quick Picks, then it makes sense that the majority of jackpots won should be won with Quick Picks. However, when you see the actual statistics, as Gail Howard did, you'll find that you have a better chance of winning by picking numbers randomly out of a hat than by using Quick Picks. </p>
<h2>In Lotto, the Trend is Your Friend</h2>
