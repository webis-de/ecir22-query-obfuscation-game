# City of Disguise: A Query Obfuscation Game on the ClueWeb

City of Disguise is a retrieval game that tests how well searchers are able to reformulate some sensitive query in a ‘Taboo’-style setup but still retrieve good results on the ClueWeb12.

You can play it at [https://demo.webis.de/city-of-disguise](https://demo.webis.de/city-of-disguise) or watch a screencast at [https://demo.webis.de/city-of-disguise/screencast](https://demo.webis.de/city-of-disguise/screencast).

To start the game locally, you can use the docker/kubernetes instructions [here](src/prototypes/game/running_prototype/app/README.md).
